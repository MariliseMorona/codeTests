## Acivity

1 - In test-driven development you think about test cases and test data first and then move on to developing a specific software functionality. Suppose you are the designer of test cases for a program that must read a person's age. What test cases and data have you defined for this program? Try to generate test cases and data using the text: https://engenhariasoftware.wordpress.com/2009/05/18/desenvolvendo-a-atividade-de-teste-de-software-%E2%80%93-parte-1/
